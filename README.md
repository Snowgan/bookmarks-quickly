# bookmarks-quickly
A chrome extension to save current active tab's url to github repository you specified. So you can quickly collect your bookmarks to github.

### First you need to create your github token and repository
1. We need a personal access token to interact with github. Please refer the guide to create a [personal access token](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-personal-access-token-for-the-command-line/).
2. Then create a repository with a README.md file. All the url will be saved to the README.md file under this repository.

### Save token and repository in option page
1. Right click the icon on extension bar and click 'Options' to open option page.
